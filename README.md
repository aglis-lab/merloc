# Merloc

**Merloc** is stand for _`merge localization`_. Mainly created because I always get so many conflict on single big translations file.

With **Merloc** I hope, I can reduce conflict with separating translations.

This package is a cli for merge **_yaml_** or **_json_** file translations into one or single **_json_** file.

This package is usefull for splitting translations to make sure the team have little conflict when merging with other team
